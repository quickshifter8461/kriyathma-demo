      "Identify and categorize the various costs influencing margins. Costs are usually categorized as variable costs (which increase directly with an increase in sales or revenue – for example raw material costs for production), semi-variable costs (which increase with sales too, but not as linearly. For example – manpower costs for some services heavy business) and fixed costs (which are not linked to the volume of products/sales/rev directly. For example – headquarter administration costs)",
